2025-01-06m

DISCO: 
- you can define functions as variables, calling them with any necessary parameters to get the value.
    - this is similar to the lambda function in DrRacket.
- relearned how to code in prefix notion.
- can use web console for JavaScript code.

QCC: 
- Difference between TypeScript and JavaScript?
- Code Editor for JavaScript?
