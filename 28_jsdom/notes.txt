K28 -- Getting more comfortable with the dev console and the DOM
2025-01-07t

DISCO: 
- wowww you can log strings, numbers, and arrays (probably anything).
	- they show up in the console with the file name and line number
- inside function -> local variable, doesn't affect outer variable even if named the same
-

QCC: 
- How would you make a global variable?
