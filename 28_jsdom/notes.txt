K28 -- Getting more comfortable with the dev console and the DOM
2025-01-07t

DISCO: 
- wowww you can log strings, numbers, and arrays (probably anything).
	- they show up in the console with the file name and line number
- inside function -> local variable, doesn't affect outer variable even if named the same
- an object can have a function inside it
- can change list colors woahhhh
	- could add a button that runs the function too
- functions work!!
- arrow function syntax doesn't need the function keyword

QCC: 
- How would you make a global variable?
- Why does JS prioritize blue over red and green (in classes)?
- Why use arrow function syntax? (Personally I think it's shorter but less readable)
